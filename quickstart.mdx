## Welcome to the Brillian DMA Course

Congratulations on taking your first step towards becoming a brilliant data and analytics
professional. 


### Tooling and Setup

Estimated time: 45 minutes
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the materials locally">
    Throughout this learning path, you'll be asked to write code and develop solutions 
    to the problems presented. To help you with this, your instructors have developed 
    a set of materials that you can clone and use on your local machine. 
    
    To clone the repository locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Run the first example">
    Run the first example in the repository to ensure that your environment is set up
    correctly. This will also help you get familiar with the codebase and the tools
    you'll be using throughout the course.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Set up your environment variables">
    Throughout the course, you'll be working with a variety of tools and services. 
    To ensure that your code runs correctly, you'll need to set up environment variables 
    that contain sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials. 
    
    Follow the instructions in the repository to set up your environment variables. At no 
    point should you ever commit your environment variables to the repository or 
    use them in your code directly.
