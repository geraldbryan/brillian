## What is data visualization?
In the big data era, the sheer volume and variety of data is actually a powerful ingredient for businesses to seek valuable insights. 
However, managing and interpreting the data could be incredibly complicated and time-consuming. This is where data visualization comes into play.

So, what exactly is data visualization?

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. 
It converts complex datasets into visual elements like charts, graphs, maps and infographics, making it easier to interpret and understand intricate information quickly.
We will be able to identify trends, outliers, patterns and correlations in the data. 
But before we delve deeper into the method, let's first learn about the history of data visualization to how it has evolved to meet changing needs.

## History of Data Visualization

Throughout history, mankind has relied on visualizations to teach, to convey messages and to narrate stories. It has always been a fundamental component in human learning and comprehension. 
The history of data visualization reflects a journey from basic graphical representations to interactive tools we use today. 
The evolution of data visualization also reflects a continual effort to make data more understandable, accessible, and actionable.

<Tip>
  The 2 common types of visual representation that humans use are:

  - **Presentation:** Uses visuals to communicate information and ideas to an audience.
  - **Visualization:** Uses visuals to aid in thinking, understanding and analyzing information.

### The Dawn of Human Visualization

Before the 17th century, data visualization was mainly confined to maps, showing landmarks, cities, roads, and resources. 
It wasn’t until 1644 that Michael Florent Van Langren, a Flemish astronomer, created what is considered the first visual representation of statistical data. 
He plotted a one-dimensional line graph displaying twelve different estimates of the longitude difference between Toledo and Rome, attributed to various astronomers. 
This graphical approach, as opposed to a table, strikingly highlighted the wide variations in these estimates.

### The Foundation of Statistical Charts

The 18th century marked the beginning of thematic mapping, encompassing geologic, economic, and medical data. 
This era introduced abstract graphs of functions, measurement errors, and empirical data collections. 
William Playfair, often regarded as the father of many popular graph types we use today, such as line, bar, and pie charts, emerged during this period. 
One of his notable works from 1821 depicted the price of wheat, weekly wages, and reigning monarchs over 250 years, illustrating the power of statistical charts for historical analysis.

Statistical graphics soon found their way into public health, famously used by Dr. John Snow during London’s cholera outbreak in 1855. 
By plotting cholera cases as dots on a map, Snow demonstrated that the majority of cases were clustered around a specific water pump on Broad Street. 
This compelling visual evidence persuaded city officials to remove the pump handle, effectively curbing the epidemic.

### The Rebirth of Data Visualization
The latter half of the 20th century saw a renaissance in data visualization, driven by the advent of computer processing. 
Computers allowed for the collection and storage of vast amounts of data and facilitated quick and easy visualization. 
Pioneers like John W. Tukey in the United States and Jacques Bertin in France advanced the science of information visualization. 
In the early 1980s, Edward Tufte's seminal work, [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.econ.upf.edu/~michael/visualdata/tufte-aesthetics_and_technique.pdf) became a cornerstone in data visualization education. 
In that book, there are some guides for enhancing the visual quality of routine 

Attractive displays of statistical information should:
- have a properly chosen format and design
- use words, numbers, and drawing together
- reflect a balance, a proportion, a sense of relevant scale
- display an accessible complexity of detail
- often have a narrative quality, a story to tell about the data
- are drawn in a professional manner, with the technical details of production done with care

With computers, data visualization reached new heights. 
Spreadsheets transformed how data was visualized, generating graphs and charts from tables without manual effort. 
This innovation made creating, updating, formatting, and editing visualizations faster and easier. 
Various enterprise data visualization software solutions soon followed, introducing new charting techniques and styles.

### 21st Century Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboards
![Tableau Dashboards](../images/data-visualization/tableau_1.jpeg)
Today, BI dashboards have become an essential tool for organizations to enable streamlined interaction and comprehension of data. 
They present critical metrics and key performance indicators on a single screen. 
The clear and well-designed visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of an organization's performance that aid in facilitating informed, data-driven decisions and strategic planning. 
In turn, encourages a data-driven culture throughout the organization by illustrating business performance relative to targets, and simplifying the visualization of complex relationships. 

## Why Data Visualization is Important?
In essence, the importance of data visualization is straightforward: it enables people to see, interact, and gain a deeper understanding of data.
Since humans rely heavily on visual perception to analyze data, converting complex datasets into suitable visual formats is crucial for its utility.
The right visualization can align everyone's understanding, regardless of their level of expertise.
Hence, using tools and technology to make data more intuitive for diverse audiences also bridges the gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

It's undeniable that the applications of data visualization is practical across various industries. It is also ever-evolving, adapting to advancements in technology and changing needs in data analysis.
The better you can visually convey your points, the more effectively you can leverage on the piece of presented information. 

Traditional education often separates creative storytelling from technical analysis, but the modern professional landscape values those who can do both. 
Data visualization lies right at the intersection of analysis and visual storytelling, making it one of the most sought after professional skills in today’s data-centric world.

However, the importance of data visualization must also inline with how the creators create the data visualization itself, there are some comparison between friendly and unfriendly graphics that used as the baseline in the modern data visualization
| Friendly                                                                                                        | Unfriendly                                                                                                    |

| words run from left to right, the usual direction for reading occidental languages                              | words run vertically, particularly along the Y-axis; words run in several different directions                |
| little messages help explain data                                                                               | graphic is cryptic, requires repeated references to scattered text                                            |
| elaborately encoded shadings, cross-hatching, and colors are avoided; instead, labels are placed on the graphic itself; no legend is required | obscure codings require going back and forth between legend and graphic                                       |
| graphic attracts viewer, provokes curiosity                                                                     | graphic is repellent, filled with chartjunk                                                                   |
| colors, if used, are chosen so that the color-deficient and color-blind (5 to 10 percent of viewers) can make sense of the graphic (blue can be distinguished from other colors by most color-deficient people) | design insensitive to color-deficient viewers; red and green used for essential contrasts                    |
| type is clear, precise, modest; lettering may be done by hand                                                   | type is clotted, overbearing                                                                                  |
| type is upper-and-lower case, with serifs                                                                       | type is all capitals, sans serif                                                                              |


Effective data visualization is the key to ensure that insights are communicated clearly and efficiently, which will equip individuals and organizations to leverage on the acquired information.

1. **Enhanced Understanding**: Intricate datasets are simplified, and the patterns and correlations that might be hidden in raw data are highlighted.
For instance, line graphs can highlight upward or downward trends over time, while scatter plots can reveal relationships between variables.

2. **Efficient Data Analysis**: Easier to spot outliers and anomalies that might indicate errors or unique insights. For example, a spike in a bar chart might signal an unusual event worth investigating further.

3. **Improved Decision-Making**: Facilitate data-driven decisions empowered with a clear, evidence-based insights.

4. **Effective Communication**: Convey complex information concisely to a wider audience, including those without a technical background. A persuasive tool in presentations and reports to support arguments or recommendations.

6. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Organizations that leverage data visualization foster a data-driven culture. With a common reference point for team discussions, employees at all levels can communicate findings and collaborate on solutions, promoting transparency and accountability.

7. **Better Data Retention**: Combining analysis with storytelling makes data more relatable and compelling. People are more likely to remember and recall information presented visually. It also facilitates quick comparisons between different datasets or variables, which aids in retention and understanding.

8. **Time Savings**: Visual tools and dashboards allow for real-time data analysis and monitoring. This enables quick responses to changes and timely adjustments to strategies, enhancing overall efficiency.

Not only learning but mastering these skills enables individuals and organizations to harness their data more effectively and achieve their objectives.
