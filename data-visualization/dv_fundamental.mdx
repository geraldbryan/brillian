![Pie Chart](../images/data-visualization/pie_chart.png)
**Function:** Showing proportions and percentages of a whole.

**Purpose:** Used to illustrate the parts of a whole, showing percentages and proportional data.

**Example:** A non-profit organization uses a pie chart to show the percentage breakdown of their budget allocation, illustrating how funds are distributed across different programs.

#### Scatter Plot
![Scatter Plot](../images/data-visualization/scatter_plot.png)
**Function:** Showing relationships between two numerical variables.

**Purpose:** Useful for identifying correlations and patterns between two variables.

**Example:** A researcher uses a scatter plot to examine the relationship between study hours and test scores among students. Each dot represents a student, with study hours on the x-axis and test scores on the y-axis.

#### Histogram
![Histogram](../images/data-visualization/histogram.png)
**Function:** Displaying the distribution of a continuous data set.

**Purpose:** Shows the frequency distribution of a continuous dataset, helping to identify patterns and outliers.

**Example:** A fitness trainer uses a histogram to show the distribution of clients' ages. The x-axis represents age ranges, and the y-axis represents the number of clients in each range.

#### Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)
![Box Plot](../images/data-visualization/box_plot.png)
**Function:** Showing the distribution of a dataset based on a five-number summary.

**Purpose:** Displays the spread and central tendency of a dataset, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

**Example:** A automobile company uses a box plot to compare the highway mileage of cars in different car types. Each box represents a car type, displaying the spread and central tendency of car highway mileage.

#### Area Chart
![Area Chart](../images/data-visualization/area_chart.png)
**Function:** Showing cumulative data trends over time.

**Purpose:** Similar to line charts but with the area under the line filled, useful for emphasizing the magnitude of changes over time.

**Example:** A music company uses an area chart to show the cumulative number of music sales by format over the past year. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of sales in USD.

#### Heat Map
![Heat Map](../images/data-visualization/heat_map.png)
**Function:** Showing intensity of data across a spectrum.

**Purpose:** Displays data where individual values are represented by colors, useful for showing the intensity of data and identifying patterns.

**Example:** A data analyst uses a heat map to show website activity, where the intensity of color represents the number of clicks on different areas of the site.

<Tip>
  By understanding the functions and purposes of different chart types, whether you're dealing with categorical, quantitative, or relational data, you can create visuals that not only capture attention but also enhance comprehension and insight.

### Effective Visualization Techniques

The effectiveness of a visualization hinges on aligning the type of chart with the nature of the data and the message you want to convey.
We’ll also delve into real-world examples and case studies to illustrate how these principles are applied in practice. 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Type">
    * **Categorical Data** -> For data that falls into distinct categories (e.g., types of fruit), use bar charts, pie charts, or stacked area charts.
    * **Quantitative Data** -> For numerical data (e.g., sales figures), consider line charts, scatter plots, or histograms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Purpose of Visualization">
    * **Comparison** -> To compare different categories or groups, use bar charts or column charts. If comparing parts of a whole, pie charts can work, though bar charts are often clearer.
    * **Trends** -> To show changes over time, use line charts or area charts. They help highlight trends and patterns.
    * **Distribution** -> To display the distribution of data, histograms and box plots are useful. They show how data is spread across different ranges.
    * **Relationship** -> To illustrate relationships between variables, scatter plots and bubble charts are effective. They reveal correlations or patterns between two or more variables.
    * **Composition** -> To show how different parts contribute to a whole, stacked bar charts or pie charts are typically used.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
When creating visualizations, it’s important to avoid common pitfalls to ensure your data is accurately represented and easily interpreted.

#### Misleading Visuals

1. **Scale Issues:** Manipulating the scale of axes can distort the data. For instance, truncating the y-axis in a bar chart can exaggerate differences between bars. 
- Always use a consistent scale or start the axis at zero to avoid misleading viewers.
2. **Inappropriate Chart Types:** Using a pie chart for data with too many categories can be confusing. Pie charts work best with a small number of categories. 
- For more categories, consider a bar chart instead.
3. **Cherry-Picking Data:** Selecting only a subset of data to support a specific narrative can be misleading. 
- Ensure your visualization represents the full dataset to provide an accurate picture.

#### Overcomplicating with Too Much Data

1. **Cluttered Visuals:** Including too many data series or categories in a single chart can make it hard to interpret. Keep your visualizations focused and use additional charts if necessary to break down complex data.
2. **Excessive Details:** Adding too many details (e.g., excessive grid lines or labels) can overwhelm the viewer. Use clean, simple designs and only include essential information to ensure clarity.
3. **Complexity Over Clarity:** Sometimes, a simple chart (like a basic bar or line chart) can be more effective than a complex visualization (like a 3D chart or interactive dashboard). Prioritize clarity over complexity to ensure your audience can easily understand the data.

## Data Storytelling
Traditional education often treats creative storytelling and technical analysis as separate skills, but today's job market values professionals who excel in both. 
However, data visualization is a prime example of where these two areas intersect, making it a highly sought-after skill in our data-driven world. 
Data storytelling involves merging solid data with compelling narratives to present insights in a way that resonates with audiences. 
This approach relies on three essential components: data, narrative, and visuals.

1. **Data:** The raw numbers and facts that provide the foundation of the story.
2. **Narrative:** The context and interpretation that give meaning to the data.
3. **Visuals:** The charts, graphs, and other visual aids that illustrate the data and narrative.

By integrating these elements, data storytelling transforms complex data sets into understandable, memorable, and actionable insights. 
The goal is to make the data not just accessible, but also engaging and persuasive, turning dry statistics into a compelling story that drives home key points.

<Note>
    Words, graphics and tables are serves a single purpose - presentating information.
    As written by Edward R. Tufte, "What is sought in design for the display of information is to achieve clear potrayal of complexity. Not the complication of the simple; rather than the task of the designer is to give visual access to the subtle and the difficult - that is the revelation of the complex."
