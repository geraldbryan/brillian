## Introduction

Much of the data we work with in the financial industry is stored in databases and accessed using SQL. 

To really unlock the power of data, your ability and general familiarity with SQL will be a huge 
advantage in your career, and is the reason why it's often a requirement for many data-related roles.

This module will cover the theoretical and practical aspects of database management and the querying language SQL.
If you do not have a database connection set up (as is expected for most learners and beginners), the best alternative is to use SQLite, which is a lightweight database engine that can be used without a server.

Follow the instructions in the [Recommended Pre-Reading](#recommended-pre-reading) section above to set up a SQLite database from a CSV file.
If you're following this module as part of a course, you will be required to complete 
that setup to be able to follow along with the lessons.
