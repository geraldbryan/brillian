## The Enterprise Analytics Landscape
Today's enterprise analytics landscape is characterized by a diverse array of data sources. Organizations now deal with data from cloud platforms, 
on-premises databases, big data systems, IoT devices, social media, and more. 

An interesting case study I like to point to is BCA (Bank Central Asia), a leading bank in Indonesia. Their customer hotline service, known as Halo BCA,
receives inbound enquiries from more than 110,000 customers daily<sup>1</sup>, most of it via phone calls but also through email and social media. BCA 
enlist the help of data solutions to launch VIRA<sup>2</sup>, an AI chatbot available on Facebook Messenger, LINE messenger and WhatsApp that can answer
customer queries with an emphasis on speed and accuracy. 

Defying most conventional definitions of banking operations, these services are examples of how varied and heterogeneous
enterprise data management has become. Just 10 years ago, one wouldn't consider a scenario where financial institutions and banks 
would have to architecturally provision for these varied forms of data sources, from audio recordings of phone calls, to text messages on social media 
and chatbots.

In the following subsections, we will take a closer look at the key components that make up 
a modern enterprise data management system, with practical examples sprinkled throughout to illustrate
how these components are applied in real-world scenarios.

By the end of the lesson, you should have a good understanding of the overarching principles of enterprise data management,
and how these principles translates to the design and implementation of effective processes that 
support analytics adoption in organizations.

## Modern Enterprise Data Management
Enterprise Data Management is a set of processes, policies and technologies that enable organizations 
to **precisely define**, **easily integrate** and **effectively retrieve** data for both internal 
applications and external communication. It encompasses the full lifecycle of data management, from
data creation and capture, to data storage, retrieval, and analysis.

    Enterprise data management (EDM) is the process of inventorying and governing your business's data 
    and getting your organization onboard with the process. In other words, EDM is 
    as much about managing people as it is about managing data. Data management means making sure your 
    people have the accurate and timely data they need, and that they follow your standards for 
    storing quality data in a standardized, secure, and governed place.

As seen above, vendors and solution providers have varying definitions of what constitutes enterprise data management, 
and what its objectives are. Through its various engagements with Indonesia's leading enterprises, Supertype has distilled
a set of key objectives and key components that are common across these many definitions, and are essential to the overarching goal of 
enterprise data management, irrespective of vendor-specific applicability.

### Objectives of Enterprise Data Management
The good of a good enterprise data management system is to provide a **single source of truth** that 
where its data is trusted to be accurate, consistent, and up-to-date.

When organizations like Bank BCA make data management a priority, users in their organization benefit from:

- **Accuracy**: They trust that the data they're using is correct, and when surveyed, responded that they are confident in the data they use.
- **Security and Compliance**: They know that the data they're using is secure and compliant with regulations such as those 
  set by the Indonesian Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or "OJK").
- **Efficient**: They know where exactly to locate the data they need quickly and easily, easily integrating and consolidating it into 
  downstream applications and analytics tools.
- **Consistent**: Employees across the organization are speaking the same language when it comes to data, and 
  are able to make decisions based on the same set of facts, standardized and governed according to the organization's data management policies.


## Key Components of Enterprise Data Management
With the primary objective of enterprise data management being trust and confidence in the data's accuracy and consistency, 
it is no wonder that companies invest considerable resources into solutions centered around a 
paradigm called "Master Data Management" (MDM).

### Master Data Management (MDM)
Master Data Management can be thought of as a sub-discipline of enterprise data management that is centered around
the **creation and maintenance** of a **single, accurate, and consistent version of the truth** for an organization's
most important data entities. These entities, known as "master data", are typically shared across multiple systems
and business processes.

#### Single Version of the Truth
When we call MDM a "single version of the truth", we typically mean it in the sense that there is no competing 
versions of the data. For example, in a bank, the customer's name, address, and contact information should be
consistent across all systems and applications that use this data -- not always straightforward, considering the number of systems 
that interact with customer data in a bank (mobile banking, internet banking, ATM, branch tellers, etc).

<Tip>
A good way to know if your organization needs MDM is to ask yourself: "Do we have multiple versions of the same data entity
across different systems, and do these versions often conflict with each other?"
</Tip>

It's a short and simple litmus test, but holding more than one copy of the same data entity across different systems is a
clear indicator that at some point, some competing versions of truth will emerge. 

Consider the common example of a scenario where a bank customer has recently taken 
out a home ownership loan through KPR ("Kredit Pemilikan Rumah"), typically managed by a special business unit ("BU") within the 
Consumer Banking division. The marketing officer who manages the customer's relationship begins to send marketing materials on 
home insurance or home renovation loans, unaware that the customer does in fact have an existing loan account held jointly 
with their spouse. As separate BUs within the bank, the lack of a single version of truth across 
these systems lead to the customer receiving multiple, sometimes conflicting, messages from the bank. In our 
example above, separate BUs within the bank are unable to agree if the customer should be 
considered a new lead for consumer loans, or if they should be considered an existing customer with an ongoing loan.

With the existence of a MDM system, business units within the bank can instead of rely on **record linkage** to match 
the customer in one database (e.g. new leads for consumer loans) to the same customer in another database (e.g. existing loans under consumer banking). 
Commonly, this is done through a unique identifier, such as the NIK (nomor induk kependudukan) in Indonesia, printed on the KTP (Kartu Tanda Penduduk, or "identity card").

### MDM in Banking
To begin constructing a MDM strategy, we typically start by identifying the key data entities that are shared across
multiple systems and business processes. Think of this exercise as one that produces a "data inventory" of sorts, 
or a requirements document that identify the necessary fields and inputs to our MDM system. 

These fields might be fed from various sources, including external tools and systems. It is a first step in starting to 
catalog your data, and to understand the relationships between these entities. We will dive into the [Entity Relationship Diagram](exercise_erd.mdx) 
in a future section, so this exercise should be seen as a precursor to that.

To help you get started, I've created a simplified overview of the key data entities in a typical MDM system for a bank:

    - Data Masking: Using data masking techniques to obscure sensitive data for non-production environments or for specific use cases.

### Implementation Challenges in Practice 
Implementing MDM across a large enterprise, especially one as complex as a banking institution, can 
be daunting. In the Enterprise Analytics model, Supertype describes this as a local optimization problem, where
each business unit within the bank is incentivized to optimize their own operations, often affirming the need 
of a BU-specific definition. 

Consider the product hierarchy in a bank, where the consumer marketing division might classify each loan products
in a way that maximizes their marketing efforts and return-on-investment frameworks. The risk management division, 
on the other hand, is unconcerned with marketing ROI, but rather with the risk exposure of each loan product. The 
two divisions might hence keep separate records of product hierarchies, tailored to their respective local optimization
objectives at the expense of overall effectiveness in the bank's MDM system.

### Data Governance 
Data governance is the establishment of policies and principles for managing data assets. We can look to the principles laid 
out from the DAMA-DMBOK<sup>6</sup> (Data Management Body of Knowledge) to guide us in the establishment of data governance policies.

I have adapted the DAMA-DMBOK principles into a 6-step process for implementing data governance in banks and financial institutions:

establishing a robust framework, developing comprehensive policies, and at the right maturity level, 
introducing technology solutions to support data governance activities.

It is a long term commitment, and one that requires the buy-in of senior management responsible for 
setting the tone for data governance practices across the organization. I've also summarized the 6-step 
process into a table format for easy reference:

#### Control Documents for Financial Institutions 
Erecting a data governance framework in a bank or financial institution is a complex process. I've 
compiled a list of control documents that might be helpful in seeing this process through.

| **Document**                           | **Purpose**                                                                                                                        | **Plan** | **Acquire** | **Process/Maintain** | **Publish/Share** | **Retain** |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Data Governance Framework**          | Define the structure and policies for managing and overseeing data across the bank. This includes data ownership, stewardship, and accountability to ensure data quality, integrity, and compliance with OJK and Bank Indonesia regulations. | ●        | ●           | ●                     | ●                 | ●          |
| **Enterprise Data Management Plan**    | Outline the methods and strategies for managing data across the bank's operations. This plan includes data integration, data quality management, and data lifecycle management to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and accessible while adhering to regulatory requirements.                      | ●        | ●           | ●                     | ●                 | ●          |
| **Data Quality Management Plan**       | Establish procedures and standards for maintaining high data quality within the bank. This includes defining data quality metrics, implementing data validation processes, and conducting regular data quality assessments to ensure that data used in analytics and reporting meets regulatory and operational standards. | ●        | ●           | ●                     | ●                 | ●          |
| **Enterprise Analytics Strategy**       | Define the approach and methodologies for leveraging data analytics to drive business insights and decision-making. This includes establishing analytical frameworks, tools, and processes for reporting, predictive modeling, and performance measurement in alignment with regulatory requirements. | ●        | ●           | ●                     | ●                 | ●          |
| **Regulatory Compliance Analytics Plan** | Detail the processes for using data analytics to monitor and ensure compliance with OJK and Bank Indonesia regulations. This includes developing analytical models for regulatory reporting, risk assessment, and compliance tracking to meet the regulatory obligations effectively.         | ●        | ●           | ●                     | ●                 | ●          |
| **Data Privacy and Security Policy**    | Define the protocols and measures to protect sensitive financial data from unauthorized access and breaches. This policy includes data encryption, access controls, and privacy practices to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and safeguard customer information. | ●        | ●           | ●                     | ●                 | ●          |


## Summary 
In this chapter, we've explored the key components of enterprise data management, with a focus on Master Data Management (MDM) and 
Data Governance in the context of banking and financial institutions. We've discussed the importance of establishing a single source of truth
for critical data entities, and the challenges and benefits of implementing MDM and data governance practices in a complex enterprise environment.

Finally, I've included a 6-step process for implementing data governance tailored to the requirements of banks and financial institutions. These 
requirements are not always unique, but are often more stringent due to the regulatory environment in which they operate. If you are 
working in a sector with less stringent regulatory requirements, you might find that the 6-step process can be adapted to suit your
organization's data management needs. To close off, I've also included a list of control documents 
that can serve as a guide as your organization embarks on the journey of establishing a robust data governance framework.

By following these guidelines and best practices, companies can enhance data quality, security, and compliance while leveraging data analytics to 
drive business growth and innovation.
